# dpkg: Annotated Version

## Overview

I've added comments to the code for a learning purpose. See the package's [original README](README) for more details.

When installed on a machine, the main `dpkg` scripts (e.g, `dpkg-buildpackage`) are installed by the package `dpkg` (in `/usr/bin`), but the `Dpkg` module is installed by `libdpkg-perl` (in `/usr/share/perl5/Dpkg`).
